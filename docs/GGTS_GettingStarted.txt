Get Grails Webapp Setup with Groovy Grails Toolsuite
----------------------------------------------------

-make sure you have the appropriate versions of grails and ggts installed (see the COTS document for versions)
-checkout source
-in the grails folder, run grails integrate-with --eclipse
    -- This will create the .project and .classpath files for eclise
-open ggts in a new workspace
-file-->import-->existing project into workspace
-point at the grails folder from the checkout and click 'Finish"
-eclipse will promt you for Grails 2.3.5 to be configured.  Say YES.
    -- you will need to point at your local grails install

-- now the console will log a bunch of stuff for environment configuration for grails.

-- eclipse then shows one error in the problems tab - compiler mismatch.  To fix this, I right clicked on the error in the Problems view and the did quick fix option 1.  Seemed to work...


Running the Webapp in GGTS
--------------------------

In GGTS, goto Navigate --> Open Grails Command Prompt
At the prompt, type RunApp

You should see the server startup at localhost.  

Try to view it in a browser at localhost:8080/mycity
