Get Grails Webapp Setup with Groovy Grails Toolsuite
----------------------------------------------------

-make sure you have the appropriate versions of grails and ggts installed (see the COTS document for versions)
-checkout source
-in the grails folder, run grails integrate-with --eclipse
    -- This will create the .project and .classpath files for eclise
-open ggts in a new workspace
-file-->import-->existing project into workspace
-point at the grails folder from the checkout and click 'Finish"
-eclipse will promt you for Grails 2.3.5 to be configured.  Say YES.
    -- you will need to point at your local grails install

-- now the console will log a bunch of stuff for environment configuration for grails.

-- eclipse then shows one error in the problems tab - compiler mismatch.  To fix this, I right clicked on the error in the Problems view and the did quick fix option 1.  Seemed to work...


Running the Webapp in GGTS
--------------------------

In GGTS, goto Navigate --> Open Grails Command Prompt
At the prompt, type RunApp

You should see the server startup at localhost.  

Try to view it in a browser at localhost:8080/mycity

NOTE: Terminating the server process via eclipse (red rectangle button) does not actually killing the process.
The server is still running. In this case we have to kill it manually outside of eclipse. 

Type netstat -a -o -n and it will bring up a network list, look at the PID (e.g. 8080) 
netstat -aon | grep 8080 (cygwin) 
netstat -aon | find /i "8080" (windows)

Then kill it, do this from cmd line:
taskkill /F /PID <PID>
